This post is largely for my own use as a launchpad to various folks' blogs but you may find it useful. In no particular order, a list of tech/software writers that I enjoy reading:
- Martin Fowler: [https://martinfowler.com/recent-changes.html]
- Julia Evans: [https://jvns.ca/]
- Charity Majors: [https://charity.wtf/]
- Uncle Bob: [https://blog.cleancoder.com/]
- Bob Nystrom: [https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/category/code/]
- Jeff Atwood: [https://blog.codinghorror.com/]
- Kent Beck: [https://tidyfirst.substack.com/]
- Joel Spolsky: [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/]
- ...

I'm missing a bunch from this list but (true to the theme for this blog) I'll add them as I think of them.
