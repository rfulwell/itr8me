My name is Rob and this is my blog.

Everything on this site is a work in progress and I'm grateful for all feedback.

I have been working in technology for three decades and along the way, I've learned a few things
and developed some opinions. This blog is my attempt to share kernels of wisdom that I've found
valuable and perhaps discuss some interesting open questions.

There are a few historical tech stories in my noggin so there's a chance they'll spill out here,
too. For example, the first time I automated myself out of a job was in the early 90s when I
briefly had a basic data entry gig at a local business near UW.

Then there's the time I accidentally DDoSed the office printer at Microsoft. Oops! ðŸ˜œ

In my non-techie life, I run a lot of stairs and generally enjoy fast motorcycles and cars (in
that order!) although my street ride is a very modest sedan. I recommend a closed course
like [Pacific Raceways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgTakNK6T6s) if you are a thrill seeker too.
